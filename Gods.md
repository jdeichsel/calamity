Defining Cards: 

### Hero
1. Diana, Goddess of the Hunt [quite literally goddess of hunting -> anti demon]
	Once per turn: Spend 2 Mana: Deal 1 damage to any non-God unit. If that unit dies this way, draw 1 card

2. Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom [wisdom and strategy -> card economy]
	Once per turn: You can pay 4 Mana: Look at the top 3 cards of the draw pile, then rearrange them in any order

4. The Morrigan [shapeshifter -> jack of all trades]
	At the start of your turn: Call out one of the following deities to gain its effect:
		- Tyr [sacrificed his hand in a fight]
			Once per turn: discard a human card from your hand or field: a non-hero God unit  of your choice gains that much power
		- Vulcan [blacksmith, empowers weapons] 
			Divine Weapons gain +1 Power
		- Hecate [goddess of magic]
			The first spell you play each turn costs -1 Mana and cannot be negated

5. Freyja, goddess of love [flirt humans -> anti human]
	(Quickplay): Once per turn: When a Human unit attacks, you can pay 1 Mana: cancel the attack
	Whenever a unit switches sides (field to field), draw 1 card

### Unit 
1. Herald of Growth
	Mana: 2 
	Power: 2 
	When you negate an enemies card or attack, this gains 1 power

2. Herald of Judgement
	Mana: 4 
	Power: 3 
	unaffected by your opponents spells 
	When an opponent uses a spell, you can return this card to your hand to negate it 

3. Gungnir #weapon["moves according to odins will" -> how to repackage that it never misses?]
	

4. Poseidons Trident #weapon [can create/remove water -> ability with water flood aoe attack?]



### Building
1. Valhalla
	Mana: 3
	When a God Unit you control would be sent to the discard pile after combat, you can pay 1 mana to add it back to your hand instead 

2. Olympus Gate
	Mana: 4  
	Once per turn: You can return one of your non-Hero units to your hand: Reduce the Mana cost of your next card by 2. [almost feel like i wanna remove the "once/turn", but can introduce loops]

3. Divine Forge of Athena
	Weapons cost -1 Mana
	[ideas: search weapons somehow, buff weapons, heroes can equip weapons and attack]


### Quickplay
1. Divine Intervention
	4 Mana 
	Negate anything (playing a card, activating an effect or an attack) and send it to the discard pile 

2. Reincarnation
	Mana: 2
	Target any card in the discard pile, add it to your hand

3. Faith of the Weak
	If a human Hero controls no Church building and has no stacks of Prayer: Convert one of his non-hero units (place it on your field)

4. Chooser of the Slain [this is another name for Valkyries, bringing dead warriors to Valhalla] 
	Mana: 3
	When any God unit fights: you can swerve the battle by 1 Power into either direction

5. Thor's Bolt
	Mana: 4
