Start of Game:
- Each Player gets 3 Random Hero Cards and choses one.
- Then each Player draws 3 Cards

- Win Condition: 
	Each hero has a Health total. When it reaches 0 that Player has lost. Play resumes until only 1 hero is still alive.

- Factions:
	The hero can have 1 of 3 factions: Demon, God or Human




General Rules:

- Mana:
	All Cards cost mana, mana is indicated by the amount of placed mana Cards the Player has, when using them they are rotated 90 Degrees counter clockwise, this is called **Exhausting**.
	A Mana can be placed in the Players Mana pile at any time during his turn, but only once that turn. 

- Discard Pile
	Any card that is destroyed, discarded or sacrificed goes to the discard pile. Any spell that is used also goes to the discard pile upon activation. There is only one discard pile that all players share.

- Units
	Units can be **played** from the hand by paying its corresponding mana cost or **summoned** from the discard pile by a card effect

- Attacking
	**Ready** units may attack during your Turn Phase
	After a unit attacks, it is **Exhausted** 
	
	Order of Steps when attacking:
	1. The Player declares an attack. They choose an Attacker on their field and a Defender on an opponents field. 
	2. Any Player may now activate an effect, see [Effect "Reactions"]
	3. Combat starts between Attacker and Defender, see [Combat]
	
	Additional Rules
	- Hero can only be targeted as a Defender if the following conditions are met:
		1. That Hero has no units on their field
		2. That Player has finished a turn already

- Combat
	Every Unit has a power stat, once that power reaches 0, it is destroyed
	
	1. If a Unit with 2 Power attacks a unit with 1 power, the unit defending dies and the attacker loses 1 power for the turn.
	2. If a Unit with 1 Power attacks a unit with 2 power, the unit attacking dies and the unit defending loses 1 power for the turn.
	3. If a Unit with 2 Power attacks a unit with 2 power, both Units die.
	4. If a Unit attacks a Hero, that Hero loses Health equal to the Units Power.
