### Feedback on new Demons

- why would it lose power? what card is doing that?
> Savage Beast - (2 Mana / 2 Power) - This doesnt lose Power while Attacking.

- this sounds kinda insane, maybe 1 unit gets +1 power? it has 2 power so can punch over cards without any investment, and then gets reward for it 
> Fallen Beast - (3 Mana / 2 Power) - When this Attacks, your other Units gain +1 Power this turn

- i went with the rework more for "exhaust, do X" and you went more for "exhaust and spend resources, do X", we kinda went opposite directions of what we had in the last draft :) you think this is a problem?

- when i imagine drawing this, i see the easy play of "play this, sacrifice itself, draw 1" or "play this, sacrifice exhausted mana to win". feel like 3 mana is too much, but 2m/2p also sounds not quite right idk 
  > Mana Spirit - (3 Mana / 2 Power) - You can Sacrifice Cards instead of Spending Mana. When this is sacrificed, Draw 1.

- Reborn Spirit looking lit, i wanna play it 

- is it "exhaust + (discard OR sacrifice)" or is it "exhaust + discard OR sacrifice"? sounds ambiguous. im guessing its the first, but its reads like the second
>Fallen Herald - (2 Mana / 1 Power) - When a Demon Battles: You can Exhaust this card and discard or sacrifice a Unit to give the Battling Demon its power until the end of this turn.

- everyone gets +1 power all the time? we put this on the heroes before, maybe a lil more situational?
> Fallen Prophet - (2 Mana / 2 Power) - When another friendly unit Battles, it gains +1 Power this turn



### Feedback on new Gods

- Divine Champion lit. like the bouncing and the versatility

- i see a lot of 1 Power cards. do you think they have tools to survive other than getting bounced? do you even deal good damage? idk how this plays into a Demon deck, much less the corgi cerberus

- small wording issue: "either" is for 2 players, but not 3 or 4 -> "any"
- this is on: Divine Champion, Celestial Nomad, Cosmic Arbiter, Starfall Sage, Portal to Heaven

- Attracting Whisper, Divine Eye, something Shapeshifter ?
> Need Name - (2 Mana / 2 Power) - When a unit is added to an Opponents Hand by your effect, it is added to your Hand instead.

- this card is so cool. theres def gonna be some insane combo where you replay the card and the "on summon" effect does some crazy shit :D big fan
  > Starfall Sage - (3 Mana / 2 Power) - Can be Played druing either Players turn. When Summoned: Return target Unit to its owner's hand, then that player may Summon a Unit with the same Power from their Hand.
  
- you need some extra text to what counter is. i dont think its a negate? does it mean you negate, and then you can activate the effect?
> Counter - (3 Mana) - Can only be Played in Response to the playing of another Card. Counter it.

- i feel like this needs a "during either players turn, at the start of the turn". if the archetype is to do things when its not your turn, this is not helping so much. and because its at start of turn, your opponent can see that you plan on doing some spells 
> Olympian Throne - (3 Mana) - You can Exhaust this Card: Your Spells cost 1 less Mana this turn. Oncer per turn: When a Card is returned to a Hand: Draw 1.

- i wanna play gods too :) they sound like they got insane synergy onto other tribes
